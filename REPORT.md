# Final Report
## Decription of project
This project is to create a website for the U3A (University of 3rd Age) organisation which focuses on creating activities for elderly people to keep their minds (and bodies) active. The website primarily focuses on advertising the services of U3A to the Townsville area (Including information for it) and allow the participants of the activity to discuss amongst themselves in a forum environment, with an FAQ to also dispense information.
## Basic workflow
1. Load up docker image (Explained further in Local environment section of report) containing the WordPress site contents
2. Open the WordPress admin page and open a page (or create a page) that a new theme change will be used in
3. Using a local editor (In my case VIM), change any relevant files that are required for the latest change in theme (theme.js, html files in parts, php files in patterns or templates are usually the files that require editing).
4. Review changes in local environment version of WordPress, repeat stage 3 until satisfied.
5. Commit changes to git and then push to github repository.
6. Review online version of site to confirm changes have been pushed to live site.
## Local Environment
The local environment used is a Docker image on my Arch Linux laptop that contains all of the neccersary files to edit and create websites in WordPress.
## Technologies used
Github, VIM, WordPress, Microsoft Azure and Docker are all used to create this project.
## Career outcomes
This assignment isn't wholly relevant to my career prospects, however, it has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding on the management of content in the modern world wide web with themes that allow for easier creations of pages and entire websites with a drag and drop functionality. It also allowed me to think more critically of my choices when it comes to front end development whenever I require to present a user facing program.
