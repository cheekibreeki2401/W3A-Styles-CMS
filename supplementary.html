    <li>The local environment used was a docker image installed on my Arch Linux system that contained a mariadb, phpmyadmin and wordpress instance which was then shared to the production environment. For this docker container and specifically the wordpress and mariadb images, I synced my theme on my local ssd (Stored in a CMS directory) to the images.</li>
